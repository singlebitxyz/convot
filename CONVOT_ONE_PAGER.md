## Convot — Your website’s AI assistant, trained on your content

### One‑liner

**Convot** lets teams embed a trustworthy AI chatbot on any website — grounded in their own PDFs, docs, and URLs — in minutes.

### What Convot does

Convot turns your existing knowledge (help docs, policies, manuals, onboarding content, internal wikis, blogs, course catalogs, product pages) into an **always‑on, on‑brand assistant** that answers visitor questions with **grounded responses and citations**.

No custom backend. No ML team. No complex setup.

---

### Who it’s for (best‑fit customers)

-   **SaaS & product companies**: Reduce support tickets, improve activation, and help users self‑serve.
-   **Education & institutions**: Answer admissions, courses, policies, schedules, and campus FAQs at scale.
-   **Knowledge‑heavy teams** (ops, HR, IT, compliance): Make policies and procedures instantly searchable via chat.
-   **Marketing & growth teams**: Convert more visitors by answering objections and guiding them to the right page.

---

### The problem

Customers and visitors want fast answers — but your information is scattered across pages, PDFs, and long documents. Search is brittle, support is expensive, and updates don’t propagate everywhere.

---

### The Convot advantage

-   **Grounded answers**: Responses are generated from your uploaded content and crawled pages.
-   **Citations built in**: Show sources (documents/URLs) so users trust what they read.
-   **Fast time‑to‑value**: Upload, train, embed. No engineering required.
-   **On‑brand control**: Customize system prompt (“voice”), behavior, and provider (OpenAI / Gemini).
-   **Analytics that matter**: See what people ask, what’s unanswered, and where your content is lacking.
